# chimeraJS
 chimeraJS is simply a rewritten „Chimera” game by Shahid Ahmad which originally has been released for Commodore64. 

##### Purpose
 chimeraJS was created as an end-year project for my upper-secondary technical school. We were actually supposed to select game which could run in C64 emulator and port it to work in web browser using only pure Javascript. What is worth mentioning the code is not perfect as I was only half year learning programming at all. So have in mind that it could contain some mayor newbie mistakes, incomprehensible solutions or whatever else.
 
##### Licensing
 The code is completely rewritten as I keep rights to it. Nonetheless graphic design, an idea for game and any sounds or music stays in rights of its original author (Shahid Ahmad) and should be respected.
